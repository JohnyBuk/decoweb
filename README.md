# Dive planner

This web application is designed to assist divers in exploring and comparing different breathing gas mixtures. It provides the ability to simulate and compare dive profiles and decompression stops based on the selected gas mixtures.

:warning: WARNING          
This application is not a substitute for proper training in deep diving. Using this application without adequate knowledge and training can be dangerous and potentially life-threatening. Always seek proper certification and training before attempting deep dives.    
 

## Features

* Gas Mixture Selection: Users can choose from a variety of breathing gas mixtures commonly used in diving, such as Nitrox, Trimix, or Heliox.

* Dive Profile Simulation: The application calculates and displays the dive profile based on the chosen gas mixture, target depth and bottom time.

* Decompression Stops: Users can view the recommended decompression stops based on the chosen gas mixture and dive profile. 

* Gas Mixture Comparison: Divers can compare multiple gas mixtures side by side to analyze how each mixture affects the dive profile and decompression requirements.
